  <h1>The Koniki</h1>
  
  <p>
    <b>The Konik</b> (Polish: <i>Konik Polski</i> or <i>Konik Biłgorajski</i>) or the 
    <b>Polish Primitive Horse</b> is a small, semi-feral horse, originating in Poland. 
    The Polish word <i>konik</i> (plural <i>koniki</i>) is the diminutive of <i>koń,</i>
    the
    Polish word for "horse" (sometimes confused with <i>kuc, kucyk</i> meaning "pony"). 
    However, the name "konik" or "Polish konik" is used to refer to certain specific 
    breeds. Koniks show many primitive markings, including a dun coat and dorsal stripe.

    Wild horses ancestors were Polish tarpans similar to those discovered in Asia by the Russian explorer Nikolai Przewalski in 1876 year Przewalski's horse . They lived until the end of the 17th century in the wooded areas of eastern Poland , Lithuania and Prussia . In the vicinity of the Bialowieza Forest survived until 1780 , when it was taken and placed in the zoo of Counts of the Zamoyski near Biłgoraj . Around 1806 , due to poverty, they were distributed to nearby peasants . In 1914, Jan Grabowski and Stanislaw Schuch described small peasant mussels from Bilgoraj [1] .

"The first attempts at conducting an organized primitive horse breeding , called Polish horses, were undertaken in Poland in 1923, at the State Stud of Janów Podlaski and in 1928 at the Dworzyszcze Folwark, belonging to the Krzemieniec Lyceum " [1] .

Professor Tadeusz Vetulani introduced the name "Polish horse", he also proposed the existence of a forest tarpaulin . Thanks to his efforts, a horse with typical tarpana characteristics was started in the reserve conditions in the Białowieża Primeval Forest [1] . In September 1939 the herd numbered 40. During World War II, Germany stole horses and transported them to the Reich for tests conducted by German researchers [2] .

After the end of the war, the rebuilding of the farm with the participation of a few horses scattered around the country and reindeer from Germany (outside the Białowieża) began. In 1949 a stud in Popielno was opened . In 1952 there was also a group of horses from Białowieża. In 1955 the stud in Popielno was taken over by the Polish Academy of Sciences , followed by the interrupted experiment by prof. Vetulani [1] [3] .

Recently a different vision for the genesis of Polish horses has been published [4] [5] [6] .
